## A Quick Overview of Instruction-Set Simulation and Tracing

The most important thing is *what does it do?* If you are building or using a simulator you need to be concerned at some level about the implementation. But first you need to figure out what you want it to do.

> *Why aren't you using the real thing? Do you want an accurate simulation? If yes, use real hardware. If no, make up the numbers. NullSIM. It's not as accurate, but it's cheaper and faster than any other simulation tool. It's the only universal simulator! Tired of configuring your simulator to do exactly what you want? Use NullSIM, with a familiar user interface and predictable results!*

Instruction-set simulators can execute programs written or compiled for computers that do not yet exist, which no longer exist, or which are more expensive to purchase than to simulate. Simulators can also provide access to internal state that is invisible on the real hardware, can provide deterministic execution in the face of races, and can be used to ``stress test'' for situations that are hard to produce on real hardware.

Instruction-level tracing can provide detailed information about the behavior of programs; that information drives analyzers that analyze or predict behavior of various system components and which can, in turn, improve the design and implementation of everything from architectures to compilers to applications.

Although simulators and tracing tools appear to perform different tasks, they in practice do much the same work: both manipulate machine-level details, and both use similar implementation techniques.

This web page is a jumping-off point for lots of work related to instruction-level simulation and tracing. Please contribute! Please send comments, contributions, and suggestions to `[`pardo@xsim.com`](http://www.xsim.com/index.html)'. If you'd like to help, edit this page, there is [lots that needs to be done](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html); your help is appreciated.

This web also page lists a few OS emulation tools. Although these don't specifically fit the category of tools covered by this page, it's interesting to consider whether you could glue together a processor emulator and an OS emulator and wind up with a whole simulated system. To date, whole simulated systems are built as integrated tools, rather than being assembled modularly.

## Terminology

Some terminology:

- *Simulation* is recreating an environment in enough detail that desired effects of a ``real'' system can be observed.
- *Instruction-Set Simulation* is simulating a processor at the instruction-set level. Instruction-set simulation is simulation that is detailed enough to run executable programs intended for the machine being simulated. It is possible to do both a more-detailed simulation, for example timing-accurate or RTL (register transfer level) simulation are even more detailed, and bus architecture or cluster simulation are less detailed.
- *Emulation* is simulation that uses special hardware assistance [[RFD 72\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Interpreter), [[Tucker 65\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Tucker), [[Wilkes 69\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Wilkes-Survey).
- The *target* machine is the one being simulated; the *host* machine is the one where the simulation runs. This terminology parallels retargetable compiler terminology. However, there is no standard terminology where the simulation framework is produced on yet a third platform. That is, a *target* simulator which runs on special *host* hardware often has the simulation software compiled on a general-purpose machine. Some have suggested ``generation host'' or ``ghost'' for the machine where the software is created, that suggests the place where the simulator runs is the ``runtime host'' or ``rhost'' (pronounced "roast").

### Purpose Of The Tool

Simulation and tracing tools can perform a wide variety of tasks. Here are some common uses:

- **atr**

  : address tracing

  Classical ``address tracing'' gathers a list of instruction and/or data memory references performed by a system. There are many variations, such as tracing only targets of control transfers or tracing other resources.

  

- **db**

  : debugging

  A simulator can help with debugging because: it runs deterministically and repeatably; it is possible to query system state without disturbing it; the simulator can be backed up to an earlier checkpoint in order to implement reverse execution (```foo` is twelve ... what was the value of `bar` in the routine we just returned from?''); and because a simulator can perform consistency checks that cannot be done on real hardware.

  

- **otr**

  : other tracing and event counting

  A generalization of address tracing is to trace, count, or categorize events on any kind of processor or system event or resource. For example, a tool may collect the common values of variables; register usage patterns; interrupt or exception event counts, timing information, and so on.

  

- **sim**

  : (instruction set) simulation

  Simulators commonly implement a processor architecture that does not yet or no longer exists. Simulators can also implement other devices such as memory, bus, I/O devices, user input, and so on.

  

- **tb**

  : tool building

  Here, ``tool building'' is meant to encompass tools that are used to build other tools, for example, a tool that builds various tracing tools is a tool-building tool, whereas a configurable cache simulator is not. The usual distinction is that a tool-building tool can be extended [[NG87](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Extension-Int), [NG88](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Extension-SWE)] using a general-purpose programming language (e.g. C, C++, ...), whereas a configurable tool is programmed with a less-powerful language e.g. a list of cache size, line size, associativity, etc.

In addition, some tools are used for

- **os**

  : operating system (OS) Emulation

  Compare OS emulation ``as a purpose'' with simulators that emulate the OS for simplicity (see [system-mode simulation or tracing](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-SYS)).

  

### Handles Application Bugs Robustly

- **No**: Application errors such as stores to random memory locations may cause the simulation or tracing tool to fail or produce spurious answers, or may cause the application program to fail in an unexpected (unintended) way or produce spurious answers.
- **Some**: Certain kinds of errors are detected or serviced. For example, application errors may be constrained so that they can clobber application data in random ways but that they cannot cause the simulation or tracing tool to fail or produce erronious results.
- **Yes**: Application errors are detected and handled in some predictable way. Typically, ``predictable'' means that the error model is the same as a reference for the target architecture.
- **Yes\***: Selectable; turning on checking may slow execution.

- **No**
- **Y1**: multiplexes all target processors on a single host processor
- **Y=**: same number of host and target processors (to be precise, should be a ``Y-'' category for several host processors per target processor).
- **Y+**: can multiplex a large number of target processors onto a potentially smaller number of host processors

- **No**
- **S**: yes, but not all kinds. For example, a tracing tool might execute the traced program correctly but fail to trace signal handlers.
- **Yes**

### Support for System-Mode Code

(Detail) ![???](http://www.xsim.com/bib/vraag.gif) THIS CATEGORY NOT YET ORGANIZED, SEE THE [SHADE PAPER](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Shade-SIGMETRICS).

- **d**: device

- **u**: user

- **s**

  : system

  

  Note: the system mode may be marked in parenthesis, e.g. (s), indicating that the host processor does not have a distinct system mode in hardware, but the tool is intended to work with (simulate, trace, etc.) operating system code.

  Processor simulators typically implement either a full procesor or just the user-mode part of the instruction set. A full simulation is more precise and allows analysis of operating systems, etc. However, it also requires implementing the processor's protected mode architecture, simulated devices, etc. An alternative is to implement just the user-mode portion of the ISA and to implement system calls (transitions to protected mode) using simulator code rather than by simulating the operating system. OS emulation is typically less accurate

  

### Input Representation

- **asm**: assembly code
- **exe**: executable code, no symbol table information
- **exe\***: executable code, with symbol table information
- **hll**: high-level language

### Implementation: Decompilation Technology

``Decompilation technology'' here refers to the process of analyzing a (machine code) fragment and, through analysis, creating some higher-level information about the fragment. For simulation and tracing tools, decompilation is typically simpler than [static program decompilation](http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/csm/decompilation), in which the goal is to read a binary program and produce source code for it in some high-level language. Simulation and tracing ``has it easy'' in comparison because it is possible to get by with a lower-level representation and also to punt hard problems to the runtime, when more information is available.

Even so, executable machine code is difficult to simulate and trace efficiently (within 2 orders of magnitude of the performance of native execution) when using ``naive'' instruction-by-instruction translation, because lots of relevant information is unavailable statically. For example, every instruction is potentially a branch target; every word of memory is potentially used both as code and as data; every mutable word of memory is potentially executed, modified (at runtime), and then executed again; and so on.

Executable machine code is also inherently (target) machine-dependent and thus lexing and parsing the machine code is a source of potential portability problems. (Note that some tools use a high-level input, so that relatively little analysis is needed to determine the original programmers intent, at least at a level needed to simulate the program with modest efficiency.)

The following is a a list of tools and papers that show how to reduce the overhead of analyzing each instruction; how to reduce the number of times each instruction is analyzed; how to perform optimistic analysis and recover when it's wrong; and how to improve the abstraction of machine-dependent parts of the tool.

### Implementation: Simulation Technology

The ``simulation technology'' is how the original machine instructions (or other source representation) gets translated into an executable representation that is suitable for simulation and/or tracing. Choices include:

- **ddi**: Decode-and-dispatch

   

  interpretation: the input representation for an operation is fetched and decoded each time it is executed.

  

- **pdi**: Predecode

   

  interpretation: the input form is translated into a form that is faster to decode; that form is then saved so that successive invocations (e.g. subsequent iterations of a loop) need only fetch and decode the ``fast'' form. Note that

  - The translation may happen before program invocation, during startup, or incrementally during execution; and that the translated form may be discarded and regenerated.
  - If the original instructions change, the translated form becomes *incoherent* with the original representation; a system that fails to update (invalidate) the translated form before it is then reexecuted will simulate the *old* instructions instead of the new ones. For some systems (e.g., those with hardware coherent instruction caches) such behavior is erronious.

  

- **tci**: Threaded code

   

  interpretation: a particularly common and efficient form of predecode interpretation.

  

- **scc**: Static cross-compilation

  : The input form is statically (before program execution) translated from the target instruction set to the host instruction set. Note that:

  - All translation costs are paid statically, so runtime efficiency may be very good. In contrast, dynamic analysis and transformation costs are paid during simulation, and so it may be necessary to ``cut corners'' with dynamic translation in order to manage the runtime cost. Cutting corners may affect both the quality of analysis of the original program and the quality of code generation.
  - Instructions that cannot be located statically or which do not exist until runtime cannot be translated statically.
  - Historically, it is difficult to distinguish between memory words that are used for instructions and those that are used for data; translating data as instructions may cause errors.
  - Translating to machine code allows the use of the host hardware's instruction fetch/decode/dispatch hardware to help simulate the target's.
  - Translating to machine code makes it easier to translate clumps of host instructions; most dispatching between target instructions is thus eliminated.

  

- **dcc**: Dynamic Cross Compilation

  : Host machine code is generated dynamically, as the program runs. Note that:

  - Translating ``on demand'' eases the problem of determining what is code and what is data; a given word may even be used as both code and data.
  - Translating to machine code is often more expensive than translating to other representations; both the cost of generating the machine code and the cost of executing it contribute to the overall execution time.
  - Theoretical performance advantages from dynamic cross-compilation may be overwhelmed by the host's increased cache miss ratio due to dynamic cross-compilation's larger code sizes [[Pittman 95\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Pittman-RISC).

  

- **aug**: Augmentation

  : cross-compilation where the host and target are the same machine. Note that

  - Augmentation is typically done statically.
  - There is a fine line between having identical host and target machines (augmetnation) and having nearly-identical machines in which just a few features (e.g. memory references) are simulated, but in which the bulk of instruction sets and encodings are identical.

  

- **emu**: Emulation: Where software simulation is sped up using hardware assistance. ``Hardware assistance'' might include special compatability modes but might also include careful use of page mappings. (See ``[emulation](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-emulation)''.)

### Match Between Host and Target

![???](http://www.xsim.com/bib/vraag.gif) THIS CATEGORY NOT YET ORGANIZED.

Generally, the closer the match between the [host](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-host) and the [target](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-target), the easier it is to write a simulator, and the better the efficiency. Possible mismatches include:

- Byte or word size. For example, [Kx10](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Kx10) simulates a machine with 36-bit words; it runs on machines with 32-bit and 64-bit words.
- Numeric representation. For example, whether integers are sign-magnitude, one's complement, or two's complement. Or, for example, [Vest](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-MX-Vest), which simulates all VAX floating-point formats on a host machine that lacks some of the VAX formats.
- Which instruction combinations cause exceptions, and how those exceptions are reported.
- Synchronization and atomicity. In particular, the details may be messy where the target machine synchronizes implicitly and the host does so explicitly, since all target operations that *might* cause synchronization generally need to be treated as if they do.

Note that target support for self-modifying code may be treated as a special case of synchronization. For example, target machines with no caches or unified instruction and data caches will typically write instructions using ordinary store instructions. Therefore, all store instructions must be treated as potential code-modifying instructions.

For timing-accurate simulation (see [Talisman](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Talisman) and [RSIM](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-RSIM)), some matches between the host and target can improve the efficiency, but many do not.



### Timing Simulation

![???](http://www.xsim.com/bib/vraag.gif) THIS CATEGORY NOT YET ORGANIZED.

Some instruction-set simulators also perform timing simulation. Timing is not strictly an element of timing simulation, but is often useful, since one major use for instruction set simulation is to collect information for predicting or analyzing performance. Important features of timing simulation include both the processor pipeline and the memory system (see [Talisman](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Talisman) and [RSIM](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-RSIM)).



### Performance

There are many ways to measure performance. Some common metrics include:

- host instructions executed per target instruction executed;
- host cycles executed per target instruction executed;
- relative wallclock time of host and target

Metrics that are more abstract have the advantage that they are typically simple to reason about and applicable across a variety of implementations. For example, host instructions may be counted relatively easily for each of a variety of target instructions, and the counts are relatively isolated from the structure of the caches and microarchitecture. Conversly, concrete metrics tend to more accurately reflect all related costs. For example the effects of caches and microarchitectures are included.l

It is worth noting that few reports give enough information about the measurement methodology in order to make a valid comparison. For example, if dilation is ``typically'' 20x, what is ``typical'', and what is the performance for ``non-typical'' workloads?

#### **EDSAC Debug**

The EDSAC Debugger uses a tracing simulator that operates by: fetching the simulated instruction; decoding it to save trace information; checking to see if the instruction is a branch, and updating the simulated program counter if it is; else placing the instruction in the middle of the simulator loop and executing it directly; and then returning to the top of the simulator loop.

As an aside, the 1951 paper on the EDSAC debugger contains a pretty complete description of a modern debugger...

#### **EEL**

EEL reads object files and executables and allows tools built on top of EEL to modify the machine code without needing details of the underlying architecture or operating system or with the consequences of adding or deleting code.

EEL appears as a C++ class. EEL is provided with an executable, which it analyzes, creating abstractions such as executable (whole program), routines, CFGs, instructions and snippets. A tool built on EEL then edits the executable by performing structured rewrites of the EEL constructs; EEL ensures that details of register allocation, branches, etc. are updated correctly in the final code.

More detailed review:

- A brief (1,000 word) history of microprogramming.

- (pg. 715) Suggested applications: emulation of existing or hypothetical machines; direct execution of high-level languages; tuning the instruction set to the application (by iterative profiling and instruction-set change).

- (pg. 715) ``Emulation is defined in this paper as the ability to execute machine language programs intended for one machine (the mulated machine) on another machine (the host machine). Within this broad definition, any machine with certain basic cpabilities can emulate any other machine; however, a measure of the efficiency of operation is generally implied when the term emulation is used. For example, ... a conventional computer [has poor] emulation efficiency ... since for each machine language instruction of the emulated machine there corresponds a sequence of machine instructions to be executed on the host machine ... (called simulation ... [Husson 70] and [[Tucker 65\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Tucker)) turns out to be significanly more efficent on micorprogrammable computers. In a microprogrammed machine, the controls for performing the fetching and execution fo the machine instructions of the mulated machine consist of a sequence of microinstructions which allows the increased efficiency.'' In short, as [Deutsch and Schiffman](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-ST-80) point out, you get hardware support for instruction fetch and decode, which are typically multi-instruction operations in decode-and-dispatch interpreters.

- (pg. 717) Description of Interpreter features that help it emulate a variety of machine architectures and instruction encodings.

- (pg. 719) ``The basic items necessary to define a machine and hence emulate it are:

  - Memory structure (registers, stacks, etc.),,
  - Machine language format (0, 1, 2, 3 address) including effective operand address calculation, and
  - Operation codes and their functional m eaning (instructions for arithmetic, branching, etc.).''

  Note that you also need e.g. data formats, an exception model, a device or other I/O model, ...

- (pg. 719) ``The process of writing an emulation therefore, involves the following analysis and the microprogramming of these basic items:

  - Mapping the registers (stacks, etc.) from the emulated machine onto the host machine.
  - Analysis of the machine language format and addressing structure.
  - Analysis of each operation code defined i the machine language.

- (pg. 719-720) ``All of the registers of the emulated machine must be mapped onto the host machine; that is, each register must have a corresponding register on the host machine. The most frequently used registers are mapped onto the registers within the Interpreter Logic Unit (e.g., registers A1, A2, A3). The remaining registers are stored either in the main system memory or in special high speed registers depending on the desired emulatin speed [[Which, I assume, means ``do you want R5 fast and R6 slow or R6 fast and R5 slow; it doesn't make sense to me that they'd offer you slower emulation as a feature --pardo]]. The machine language format may be 0, 1, 2, 3 address or variable length for increased code density, and may involve indexing, indirection, relative addressing, stacks and complex address conversions.

- Summary: You're probably already familiar with the concepts in this paper. The paper describes the overall structure of a classic [decode-and-dispatch interpreter](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-ddi); this one happens to use microcode, but many of the same features are the same when using normal machine code. The opportunity with microcode (which tends to be poorly stated in all of these papers) is that writable microcode allows the use of a machine with a very fast and very flexible but very space-consuming instruction set; microcode makes such an instruction set useful by providing a fast mechanism for mapping that instruction set to a denser representation (the one stored in primary memory). In the particular case of emulation, much of the interpreter can be written directly in the low-density machine code and can take advantage of that code's flexibility and performance without being hurt by the low encoding density.

#### **New Jersey Machine Code Toolkit (NJMCT)**

The New Jersey Machine Code Toolkit lets programmers decode and encode machine instructions symbolically, guided by machine specifications that mappings between symbolic and machine (binary) forms. It thus helps programmers write applications such as assemblers, diassemblers, linkers, run-time code generators, tracing tools, and other tools that consume or produce machine code.

#### **Partial Emulation**

*Summary:*

> Virtual machines (VMs) provide greater flexibility and protection but require the ability to run one operating system (OS) under the control of another. In the absence of virtualization hardware, VMs are typically built by porting the OS to run in user mode, using a special kernel-level environment or as a system-level simulator. ``Partial Emulation'' or a ``Lightweight Virtual Machine'' is an augmentation-based approach to system-level simulation: directly execute most instructions, statically rewrite and virtualize those instructions which are ``tricky'' due to running in a VM environment. Compared to the other approaches, partial emulation offers fewer OS modifications than user-mode execution (user-mode Linux requires a machine description around 33,000 lines) and higher performance than a full (all instructions) simulator ([Bochs](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Bochs) is about 10x slower than native execution).



The implementation described here emultes all privilged instructions and some non-privileged instructions. One approach replaces each ``interesting'' instruction with illegal instruction traps. A second approach is to call emulation subroutines. ``Rewriting'' is done during compilation, and the current implementation requires OS source code [[EY 03\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Partial-Emulation).

The approach here must: detect and emulate privileged and some non-privileged instructions; redirect system calls and page faults to the user-level OS; emulate an MMU; emulate devices.

The implementation with illegal instruction traps uses a companion process and debugger-type accesses to simulate interesting instructions. Otherwise, the user-level OS and its processes are executed in a single host process. The ``illegal instruction trap'' approach inserts an illegal instruction before each ``interesting'' instruction. The companion process then skips the illegal instruction, simulates the ``interesting'' instruction, then restarts the process. It is about 1,500 lines of C code. The ``procedure call'' approach is about 1,400 lines but is faster. There are still out-of-process traps due to e.g., MMU emulation (ala [SimOS](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-SimOS)).

For IA-32, the ``interesting'' instructions are `mov`, `push`, and `pop` instructions that manipulate segment registers; `call`, `jmp`, and `ret` instructions that cross segment boundaries; `iret`; instructions that manipulate special registers; and instructions that read and write (privileged bits of) the flag register.

Not all host OSs have the right facilities to implement a partial emulator.

Some target OS changes were needed. For NetBSD, six address constants were changed to avoid host OS conflicts, and device drivers were removed. For FreeBSD, there were also replaced BIOS calls with code that returned the needed values; had they tried to implement (run) the BIOS the system would need to execute virtual 8086 mode.

User-level execution speed was similar to native. For OS-intensive microbenchmarks, the ``illegal instruction trap'' implementat was at least 100x slower than native (non-virtual) execution and slower than Bochs. The ``procedure call'' approach was 3-5x faster, but little slower than Bochs and still 10x slower than VMware which was in turn 4x-10x slower than native. A test benchmark (`patch`) was 15x slower using illegal instruction traps and about 5x slower using procedure calls. For comparison, VMware was about 1.1x slower.

The paper proposes using a separate host process for each page table base register value in order to reduce overhead for MMU emulation.

#### **Shade**

Shade combines efficient instruction-set simulation with a flexible, extensible trace generation capability. Efficiency is achieved by dynamically compiling and caching code to simulate and trace the application program; the cost is as low as two instructions per simulated instruction. The user may control the extent of tracing in various ways; arbitrarily detailed application state information may be collected during the simulation, but tracing less translates directly into greater efficiency. Current Shade implementations run on SPARC systems and simulate the SPARC (Versions 8 and 9) and MIPS I instruction sets.

#### **Sleipnir**

Sleipnir is an instruction-level simulator generator in the style of *yacc*. The configuration file is extended C, with special constructs to describe bit-level encodings and common code and support for generation of a threaded-code simulator.

For example, `0b_10ii0sss_s0iidddd` specifies a 16-bit pattern with constant values which must match and named ``don't care'' fields `i` (split over two locations), `s`, and `d`. Sleipnir combines the various patterns to create an instruction decoder. Named fields are substituted in action rules for an instruction. For example, `add 0b_10ii0sss_s0iidddd { GP(reg[$d]) = GP(reg[$s]) + $^c }`. Here, `^` indicates sign-extension. Threaded-code dispatch is implied.

For simple machines, Sleipnir can generate cycle-accurate simulators. For more complex machines, it generates ISA machines. Threaded-code simulators are typically weak at VLIW simulation and machines with some kinds of exposed latencies. Threaded-code simulators typically simulate one instruction entirely before starting the next, but with VLIW and exposed latencies, the effects of a single instruction are spread over the execution of several instructions. Sleipnir supports some kinds of exposed latencies by running an `after()` function after each instruction. Simulator code that creates values writes them in to buffers, and code in `after()` can copy the values as needed to memory, the PC, and so on.

Reported machine description sizes, speeds, and level of accuracy include the following. ``Speed'' is based on a 250 MHz MIPS R10000-based machine.

In Norse mythology, ``Sleipnir'' is an eight-legged horse that could travel over land and sea and through the air.

#### **SoftPC**

SoftPC is an 8086/80286 emulator which runs on a variety of host machines. The first version implemented an 8086 processor core using an interpreter. It provided device emulators for EGA/VGA and Hercules graphics, hard disks, floppies, and and an interrupt controller.

In about 1986, [Steve Chamberlain](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Chamberlain) developed a dynamic cross-compiler for the Sun 3/260. The basic emulation structure is an array of bytes for simulated memory and and an ``action'' array, which is a same-size array of bytes. There are then three arrays `R`, `W`, and `X` for reads, writes, and execution; each is subscripted by the ``action'' byte and contains a pointer to the correspondition read, write, or execute action. For example, a read of location `17` is implemented by reading `a = action[17]`, then branching to `R[a]`. Similarly, executing location 17 is implemented by reading `a = action[17]`, then branching to `X[a]`. The default action is that each instruction is interpreted.

Each branch invokes the translator. The translator (dynamic cross-compiler) generates a translation that starts at the last branch and goes through the current branch. SoftPC then records the current branch target, which is the starting place for the next branch's translation. SoftPC ``installs'' the translation by allocating a byte subscript `a`, then it fills in the action table with the value `a` and sets `R[a]` to act as a normal read; `W[a]` to invalidate the corresponding translation; and `X[a]` to point to the new translation. For each byte ``covered'' by the translation, the action table is set to a byte value that will invalidate the translation. For each translation, SoftPC also sets a back-pointer in a 256-entry table so that when a particular translation is being invalidated it is easy to find the location in the ``action'' table which currently uses that translation.

There are thus a maximum of 256 translations at any time (actually 254 due to reserved byte values). The simulated system had up to 1MB RAM. In about 1988 Henry ??? extended the system to use the low bit of the address as part of the subscript, in order to expand the table to 512 translations. This is used in the first Apple MacIntosh target of SoftPC.

SoftPC emulates many devices, including EGA, VGA, and Hercules video; disks, including floppies and hard disks; the interrupt controller; and so on. In about 1987, [Steve Chamberlain](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Chamberlain) implemented an 8087 (FP coprocessor) that was not a faithful 8087 (e.g., did not provide full 80-bit FP) but which provided sufficient accuracy to run common applications.

An Atari ST emulator that runs on (at least) a Sun SPARC IPC under SunOS 4.1; it emulates an MC68000, RAM, ROM, Atari ST graphics, keyboard, BIOS, clock and maybe some other stuff. On a SPECint=13.8 machine it runs average half the speed of a real ST.

#### **T2**

T2 is a SPARCle/Fugu simulator that is implemented by [dynamically cross-compiling](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-dcc) SPARCle code to SPARC code. It simulates both user and system mode code and was used for doing program development before the arrival of SPARCle hardware.

The name T2 is short for ``Talisman-2''. Note that, despite the similarity in names, [Talisman](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Talisman) and T2 share little in implementation or core features: the former uses a [threaded code](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-tci) implementation and provides timing simulation of an m88k, while the latter uses dynamic cross-compilation and provides fast simulation of a SPARCle.

#### **Talisman**

Talisman is a fast timing-accurate simulator for an 88000-based multiple-processor machine. Talisman provides both user-mode and system mode simulation and can boot OS kernels. Simulation is reasonably fast, on the order of a hundred instructions per simulated instruction. Talisman also does low-level timing simulation and typically produces estimated running times that are within a few percent of running times on real hardware. Note that e.g. turning off dynamic RAM refresh simulation makes the timing accuracy substantially worse!

*Wine* is a Microsoft Windows(tm) [OS emulator](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-purpose-os) for i*86 systems. Most of the application's code runs native, but calls to ``OS'' functions are transformed into calls into Unix/X. Some programs require enhanced mode device drivers and will (probably) never run under Wine. Wine is neither a processor emulator nor a tracing tool.

## Glossary

A glossary of some terms used here and in the cited works.

See also [Terminology](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Terminology).

- An

   

  *application*

   

  is some code (program or program fragment) that is executed or traced by one of the tools described here.

  Note that an operating system is considered an application: it is thus possible to speak distinctly of the [host](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-host) and [target](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-target) operating systems.

  The target operating system may itself be managing programs; these are considered to be a part of the OS ``application'' and are refered to as ``user-mode parts of the application''.

  

- *Emulation*

   

  is simulating a

   

  target

   

  machine using both software and a

   

  host

   

  machine that has special hardware to help speed the simulation.

  See: [[Tucker 65\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Tucker); referenced by [[Wilkes](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Wilkes-Survey)] as the original definition.

  

- *Fidelity*

   

  From Paul A. Fishwick

   

  <fishwick@cis.ufl.edu>

  : ``Simulation fidelity'' is usually captured under the title ``Validation'' within the simulation literature, and within modeling literature in general. A good place to start with validation is the proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference since the first part of the proceedings is dedicated to tutorials and introductions. Recently, Sargent had a tutorial on validation and you may find others as well.

  

- The

   

  *host*

   

  machine is the ``real machine'' where the simulation or tracing is finally run. Compare to the

   

  target

   

  machine, which is the machine that is being simulated or traced.

  Note that the host and the target may be the same machine, e.g. a V8 SPARC simulator that runs on a V8 SPARC. See also [virtual host](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-virtual-host).

  There are many other terms that can and have been used for host and target. For example, [[Wilkes](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Wilkes-Survey)] refers to them as the ``object machine'' and ``subject machine''.

  

- *Static*

   

  analysis, optimization, etc. is performed using the static code but no runtime data.

  Compare to dynamic or runtime operations, which may use program data and which may be interleaved with program execution.

  Note that *static execution* is possible, but is limited to pieces that do not depend on program data or places where data values is speculated and a ``backup'' mechanism is available where the speculation was erronious.

  

- The

   

  *target*

   

  machine is the machine that is being simulated or traced. The target machine may be old hardware (e.g. machines that no longer exist), proposed hardware (e.g. machines that do not yet exist), or machines that do currently exist, but for which it is nonetheless valuable to perform simulation or tracing. Compare to the

   

  host

   

  machine, which is the real machine that actually executes the simulation and tracing code.

  Note that the host and target may be the same machine, e.g. a V8 SPARC simulator that runs on a V8 SPARC.

  There's reportedly an IBM paper that referes to the target as the ``guest'' machine.

  

- The term

   

  *virtual host*

   

  may be used when there are several levels of simulation and tracing. For example,

   

  SoftPC

   

  can run on a SPARC and simulate an 8086; that simulated 8086 can then execute

   

  Z80MU

  , which rus on an 8086 and simulates a Z80. As far as Z80MU is concerned, it is running on an 8086 host; the simulated 8086 provided by SoftPC is thus a virtual host for Z80MU.

  Note that the real host and the virtual host may be the same machine. For example, [Shade](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Shade) runs on a V8 SPARC and simulates a V8 SPARC, and so Shade can simulate a V8 SPARC that is running Shade that is simulating a V8 SPARC that is running an application.

  \bibitem{FN:75} M. J. Flynn, C. Neuhauser, ``EMMY -- An Emulation System for User Microprogramming,'' National Computer Conference, 1975, pp.~85-89.Review/summary by [Pardo](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Pardo):EMMY is a user-microprogrammable machine designed to allow easy microprogramming in order to emulate other machines. The goal is to facilitate inter-architecture comparisons, analyze the effectiveness of architectures and compilers (optimizations) through ``software probes'', and to develop new architectures (in order to solve the ``semantic gap'' problem).Features of special hardware include: field handling and selection, shifting, extensive bit testing and flexible specification of data paths (which they call ``residual control''; I don't understand the last one).EMMY was designed with ``severe'' cost constraints. Goal is to fit whole CPU on one PC board. It is 32-bit, 4,096 words (32-bit) of microstore. There are 7 general-purpose registers and an eighth status register that includes condition codes, memory busy, status (halt/run/disable interrupts) and microinstruction PC.Each microinstruction has ``a high degree of parallelism'' for a ``machine of this size'', by which I assume they mean something that is ~vertically microcoded. Each 32-bit microinstruction is, basically, a 2-wide VLIW, where one half performs logical and branch operations and the other branch and memory operations.Implemented in TTL plus some MECL-10K (a Motorola ECL). The CPU is on a 12" x 15" card with micromemory and console logic on separate cards. The clock is 25ns; microstorage has 60ns to access, with a 200ns cycle time; microinstructions are typically executed every 200ns; they estimate it takes ~10 microseconds to execute each simulated instruction.No discussion of multitasking/privilege/VM/etc.

  \bibitem{Halfhill:00} [Tom. R. Halfhill](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Halfhill), ``Transmeta Breaks x86 Low-Power Barrier,'' Microprocessor Report, Feburary 14, 2000.Review/summary by [Pardo](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Pardo):Basic architecture: a VLIW core plus software to translate x86 code to native VLIW code at run time.Related tools include: FWB's SoftWindows for the Macintosh and Unix, Connectix's Virtual PC for the Macintosh, FX!32 for Alpha, Sun's HotSpot Java JIT.All are "emulators" -- optimizing and caching translated code is a performance-enhancing techique that does not change the fundamentals of what is going on.Crusoe has special hardware to assist emulation.Related tools include International Meta Systems (IMS) 3250, a never-produced design to emulate x86, 68K and 6502 using customizable microcode plus ... (See uPR 5/6/92-03, ``Microcode Engine Offers Enhanced Emulation'').Crusoe hardware is not specifically for x86 emulation; to boost performance of any non-native executables. For example, see Transmeta Java->VLIW demonstration. Still, probably more than coincidence Crusoe chips have 80-bit FP, partial register writes, etc.Crusoe's most important accomplishments:combining VLIW and emulation;HW/SW technology to vary processor voltage and frequency adaptively depending on workload (``LongRun'');new standard for low power among x86-compatible processors;sacrifice less performance to emulation than other software translators -- Crusoe chips are slower than other similar-frequency x86 processors, but because the core is optimzed for low power, not high perfornace.700MHz Crusoe is about 70% the speed of a 700-MHz Pentium III.Integrated PCI controller, DRAM controllers, and other components of a traditional north bridge. Gains power consumption and efficiency of on-chip memory controllers.Architectural features of little importance to SW developers because nobody writes software for the native architecture.Different Crusoe models not compatible at the host level, are compatible at the target level.Discussion of LongRun. [[Not relevant to this page except to note that it is transparent. --pardo]]Overhead of emulation is highly variable. Traditionally about 10:1. Modern emulators use caching, optimized recompilation for 4:1.For mobile markets, x86 has historically be ousted by RISCs due to lower power consumption of RISCs.x86 instruction decoding in software.Current Intel/AMD processors convert x86 to micro-ops, while Cycrix and Centaur execute x86 directly. Micro-op tranlsationa adds a pipe stage and has more overhead (microcode call) for complex instructions."Micro-op" conversion in software saves control logic and simplifies chip design.Can fix many kinds of bugs in software.Emulation is at least as old as 1964, with IBM's S/360 provided emulation for IBM's older 1401s. [[Arguably, [[Gill 51\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-EDSAC-Debug). See also [[Tucker 65\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Tucker) and [[Wilkes 69\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Wilkes-Survey) -- pardo]]What is new: emulation is not an alternative, it is the whole strategy. [[Arguably, microcode is "the whole strategy" for many processors; but Crusoe uses dynamic compilation of microcode and skips most hardware used in a traditional microcode approach. --pardo]]HW features to assist CMS:register files, many with shadows;gated store buffer;80-bit FP registers;per-instruction "commit" bit;alias hardware to allow memory reference reordering;MMU protection of translated memory;special caches for translation softwareShadow state lets Crusoe execute speculatively and out of order. On an exception, can roll back to most recent committed state by a simple copy. Preserves prcecise exception model.On boot, reserves fixed block (e.g., 16MB) for translator and recompiled code.Interpretation requires at least 12 clock cycles per x86 instruction.Dynamically profile code and select it for translation, maybe optimization.Granularity of translation is one or more basic blocks.Familiar optimizations: loop unrolling, common subexpression eliminiation, loop-invariant code removal, ... Some are x86-specific: skip redundant sets of x86 condition codes. Some are VLIW-specific: combine multiple x86 blocks into one VLIW block.Code expansionby increasing the number of instructions to do the same work; orby translating compact x86 instructions to longer VLIW equivalents.Example from [[Transmeta 00\]](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Bib-Transmeta-Crusoe):20 x86 instructions to 10 VLIW instructions but 23 "useful" VLIW packets plus 7 NOP packets. Total 32 subinstructions, 50% more than the original x86 code.Further expansion because VLIW packets are 32b, but "typical" x86 instructions are 16-24b.I$ expansion may be 33% to 150%Reduces effective size of caches including translation cache.If translation cache flushing is often, hard to amortize cost of translation.Cost of extra RAM for translation cache.No free lunch -- tradeoff to get lower power.It is a VLIW, efficiency depends on scheduling -- no dynamic reordering hardware. For comparison, the IA-64 group has been refining Multiflow's VLIW compiler for years; Transmeta started from scratch, and the compiler has to run in real time, not overnight.Factor in Crusoe's favor: monitor actual usage.At time of writing this article, all results based on Transmeta claims, no independent results.Crusoe's technology defies benchmarking: too heavy on repetitive loops, overestimates performance; conversely, low-repeat benchmarks may underestimate real performance. Battery tests, similar: unless they mirror real-live use cloesly, they will not represent what average users can expect.Emulator is no longer new technology: Java JIT compilers, Windows emulators, dozens of emulators including otherwise-dead machines like Apple II, Atari 2600, Commodor 64.

Demonstrated by comparing the inner loop code for an interpretive ([ddi](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-ddi)) processor emulator to the inner loop code for a [dynamic cross-compiler](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-dcc). With perfect cache hit ratios, the former would take 61 cycles while the latter would take 18. However, due to cache miss costs, the ``18-cycle'' version took longer to run.

  \bibitem{Wilkes:69} [Maurice V. Wilkes](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Whos-Wilkes) ``The Growth of Interest in Microprogramming: A Literature Survey,'' Computing Surveys 1(3):139-145, September 1969.Excerpts:(pg 142): ``1965 and 1966 saw papers on an entirely new subject, namely the emulation of one computer by another [42-44]. Tucker [38] defined an emulator as a package that includes special hardware and a complementary set of software routines. An emulator runs five or even ten times as fast as a purely software simulator. Tucker goes on to discuss the design of emulators for large systems. It is only in very unusal circumstances that it is practicable to write a microprogram that implements directly on the object machine [[*[host](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-host)* --pardo]] the instruction set of the subject machine [[*[target](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Glossary-target)* --pardo]]; this is because of differences in word length, processor structure, and so on. Tucker recommends that in order to design an emulator, one should first study a simulator and see in what areas it spends most of its time. This analysis will generally lead to the identification, as candidates for microprogramming, of a group of special instructions which are related tnot to specific instructions of the sbuect machine but rather to problems common to many such instructions. The most important of these special instructions is likely to be one that performs a similar function to the main loop in an interpreter and sends control to an appropriate software simulator for each instruction interpreted. Another will probably be an instruction that performs a conditional test in the way that it is performed on the subject machine. It may also be worthwhile adding special instructions to deal with such instructions of the subject machine as are difficult to simulate. If this procedure is carried to the extreme, the software simulation disappears altogether and we have a *full hardware* feature. Full hardware features are econimically practicable only for small machines (McCormack, et al [41]).Sometimes the design of an emulator can be much simplified if a small change or addition is made to the register interconnection logic of the object machine; an example, cited by Tucker, is the addtion of a small amount of logic to the IBM System 360/65 processor in order to facilitate the emulation of overflow detection on IBM 7090 shifts. Such addtions (if made) can enable the efficiency of the emuator as a whole to be imrpoved to a useful extent. Sometimes more substantial additions are worthwhile, such as hardware registers intended to correspond to particular register on the subject machine. By careful design of an emulator it is even possible to handle correctly certain types of fuction that are time-dependent on the subject machine. McCormack, et al [41] gives an example of a case in which hardware additions to the object machine were necessary in order to enable it, when running under the mulator, to handle data at the rates required by certain peripheral devices. It is generally found that, in order to accomodate an emulator, it is necessary to provide a section section to the read-only memory approximately equal in size to the section that holds the microprogram for the basic instruction set. There is no doubt that emulators will be of great economic importance to the computer industry in the future, and the fact that they can be provided relatively easily on a microprogrammed computer is an argument in favor of microprogramming as a design method.... Opler [45] has suggested the term *firmware* [... and ...] suggests that firmware may take its place along with software and hardware as one of the main commodities of the computer field.[38] Tucker, S.

  \bibitem{Wilner:72} W. T. Wilner, ``Design of the Burroughs B1700,'' Fall Joint Compuer Conference, 1972, 489-497.Excerpts:The B1700 uses user-programmed microcode that is dynamically swapped to and from main memory. The goal is to support multitasking in an environment where there are many macro-machines, each tailored to a particular high-level language or machine simulation.(pp. 489-490) The design rationalle is that good performance is achieved only if programs are executed by a machine that closely resembles the language (the ``semantic gap'' argument). Includes target machine emulation as a language.(pg. 491) The B1700 includes: bit-level memory addressability, microcode (conceptually) executed from main memory to allow interleaved program execution; 16-bit microinstructions; 2/4/6 MHz micro-issue; 14-53 microseconds to reconfigure (swap instruction sets) at 6MHz; compilers ``may not'' generate code for the microengine, thus ensuring portability.(pg. 492) All memory accesses are via a transliteration processor that maps variable-width bit-addressed references onto main memory.(pg. 493) Switching interpreters between instructions is useful not only for context switches but also for switching e.g. between traced and non-traced execution.(pg. 493) Microcode logically executes out of main memory, but may actually use processor-local memory.(pg. 495) Running-time comparisons indicate that an RPG-II program runs an order of magnitude faster than on an IBM System/3 that has a similar lease rate (memory bound); another set of (banking) benchmarks ran in 50% to 110% of the System/3 time (not clear if I/O bound, but the B1700 had a slower card reader). Notes that B1700 supports bit-variable addressing, segmented virtual memory, multitasking, ...Microarchitecture not clearly described. Note that uses 16-bit (vertical) microcode. Might actually be a two-level scheme as in [The Interpreter](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Interpreter).

## Comments on Some Of The Papers

- [EDSAC Debug](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-EDSAC-Debug) introduces several things including: [multiple strategy execution](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-multiple) that switches between simulation for tracing and direct execution for speed; and [displaced execution](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-DCDE) that simulates an instruction by copying it from its original location. EDSAC Debug also describes a fairly modern debugger; the paper is from 1951!
- [ST-80](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-ST-80) introduces the idea of dynamically cross-compiling groups of instructions from the simulated target machine to run directly on the host machine. [Mimic](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Mimic) extends this idea to work on a real (non-virtual) instruction set and shows how several important optimizations can be performed using runtime information.
- [`g88`](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-g88) shows how a simple and portable interpreter can simulate a processor with modest slowdown.
- [`g88`](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-g88) also introduces fast sophisticated address translation used to implement multiple-domain and system-mode simulation. One of the [SimICS](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-SimICS) papers shows a construction for optimizing and abstracting address translation. [SimOS](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-SimOS) shows how to do use the host's MMU to perform address translation even faster.
- [CRISP](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-CRISP) introduces the idea of dynamic compilation of machine instructions to microcode.
- [Kx10](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Kx10) shows how to simulate a 36-bit DEC-10 on machines that have 32-bit words.
- [Mime](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Mime) introduces the notion of checkpointing and rollback of simulator state, used to simulate and trace the effects of e.g. speculative execution.
- [OM](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-OM) describes tool-building tools for tracing.
- [Talisman](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Talisman) introduces fast approximate timing simulation that can estimate program running time with high accuracy (within a few percent; turning off e.g. dynamic RAM refresh simulation reduces accuracy dramatically), while adding only several tens of instructions to the cost of each simulated instruction.
- Mshade (a component of [SimOS](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-SimOS)) and [T2](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-T2) use [dynamic cross-compilationr](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Category-sim-int-dcc) to implement system mode code. There is often less benefit over interpretation because system code tends to have checking overheads that narrows the gap between translation and interpretation.
- [WWT](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-WWT) applies the idea of exploiting hardware features to use distributed shared virtual memory for user-mode multiprocessor simulation and tracing. [Tapeworm II](http://www.xsim.com/bib/index1.d/Index.html#Tool-Tapeworm-II) extends the idea to use general memory reference exceptions for general user and system-mode tracing.

  > It is less liable to cause legal troubles with copyright owners' rights to control all derivative works, because the RTCG's result is only a transient copy rather than a permanently stored codefile. RTCG-based emulation techniques are legal IFF the 1995 generation of chips' hardware-implemented transformations at icache load time are legal.

  which,

   

  Duane Sand

   

  says (paraphrasing):

  > Describes two variations of Apple's 68K interpreter it used in the initial PowerMacs. Both variations identify frequently executed blocks of 68K code, compile them with trivial peephole optimizations into host RISC code, hold the code in a software-managed "cache" until it's full, then throw it all away and start over. One variation is used on Unix emulations of Apple, and the other variation is used on the 'Power Mac 9500', in combination with a modified interpreter with a smaller lookup table footprint than in the first generation PowerMacs. (The original interpeter used so much lookup table space that it ran poorly on the original PPC 603 chips, which held up Apple's plans for laptop PowerMacs for a year.) On PowerMacs that are able to run both old & new versions, the new version averages 20-30% speedup over the entire (nonnative) application.

- One advantage of running a simulator on a segmented machine (such as the 80386) is that you can set aside a segment to use for application addreses. Then, bogus application addresses can't ``wrap'' to valid simulator addresses. The advantage is that you can get the benefits of full address mapping (e.g.,

   

  `g88`

  ,

   

  SimOS

  ) without paying the translation overhead. Of course segmented machines are harder to simulate efficiently...

- #### Subsections

  This file is easiest to edit and browse (sometimes) if it is one big file, but it (a) takes forever to load and (b) screws with some browsers. Ideally, it should be possible to build a script that takes the big thing as input and makes it into a bunch of little things. Doing it in a couple of passes would even be alright, so that intra-document links would get fixed up correctly. For example:

  - Build a tool that generates one .html file for each header up to the next header. Do one file per <h2> or one file per <h2> and <h3> or <h2> <h3> <h4> (currently only nested to <h4>).
  - Scan each HTML file for name="..." constructs and build an index of `{"#name", "file#name"}` tuples. Easy to distinguish file-relative references from absolute names becaues the absolute ones all start with "http:" or "ftp:" or whatever, while the relative ones start with "Tool-" or "Bib-" or "Whos-" or whatever.
  - Go back and edit every .html file, replacing each occurance of `href="#name"` with `"file#name"`, as described by the index tuple file.

  It's a simple Perl script, write it and get credit for helping out!

  Pardo

   

  has a copy. Executive summary: debugging tool; statically patches loads and stores with code to check for data breakpoints.

  Amusing story: The processor they were running on has load delay slots and does not have pipeline interlocks. Their tool replaces each load or store with several instructions; it patched a piece of user-mode code of the form

  ```
  load addr -> r5
  store r5 -> addr2
  ```

  Before patching, the code saved the

   

  old

   

  value of

   

  r5

   

  to

   

  addr2

  . After patching, it saved the new value. Technically, this code was broken already because the symptom could have also been exhibited by an interrupt or exception between the load and the store.

It includes a lot of features that have appeared in ATOM, including the simulator with the benchnark into a single ``self-tracing'' binary.

Spike is still in occasional use, but has never been released.''

  Basic summary: Wanted to profile. -p/-pg code is larger and slower by enough to make it hard to justify profiling as he default. Assumes the entire source is available. For these and other reasons, wrote jprof which operates with disassembly, analysis and rewriting. Discusses sampling errors, expected accuracy, stability, randomness, etc. Describes jprof: counters and stopwatches; subroutine call graph. Domain/OS on HP/Apollo using 68030. Discusses shared libraries. Can also use page-fault clock. 4-microsecond clocks. Some lessons/observations. Doesn't explain how program running time is affected by jprof.

  Summary: DEC is running Win32 application binaries on Alpha by a new combination of interpreter and static translator. The static translator runs in the background, between the first and second executions of the application. It uses info collected by the interpreter during the 1st run, to reliably distinguish active code paths from r/o data and work out the effects of indirect jumps. Static analysis can't do this automatically on its own, for typical x86 binaries.

  - portable to GNU gcc/g++ supported platforms, operating systems and processors
  - detailed instrumentation of instruction usage
  - no source code modification necessary
  - no restrictions for the application programmer (only "-a" switch for gcc/g++ compilers)
  - applicable to statically linked libraries
  - minimal slow down of program execution time (about 5%)
  - fast: no source recompilation necessary for repeated simulation runs
  - less amount of trace data produced
  - high reliability: no executable modification
  - covered by GNU Public License
  - available via anonymous ftp at: [ftp://ftp.lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/pub/iprof](ftp://ftp.lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/pub/iprof)

  The operation is: With gcc/g++ option -a (above version 2.6.3) you can produce a basic block statistics file (bb.out), which contains the number of times each basic block of the program is acccessed during runtime.

   

  iprof

   

  processes this basic block statistics file and accesses the program's executable to summarize the machine instructions used for each basic block. So

   

  iprof

   

  doesn't make any modifications to the gcc/g++ and is easily portable among gcc/g++ supported architectures. Currently binaries for LINUX 486, Pentium and Sparc Solaris are provided, ports to other architectures are straightforward.

  

- There are many ways to measure slowdown. Each has certain benefits, each has shortcomings.

  - Time to execute target code on simulated target vs. native target running time. This is particularly interesting if you are trying to deterine relative performance for a cmmercial product such as SoftPC or if you're otherwise interested in real-time response. However, it ignores the implementation technology of the host machine. For example, a simulated Z-80 on a SPARC will be faster than a simulated SPARC on a Z-80, and performance may vary by 6X depending on which Z-80 you use.
  - The time or number of host instructions to execute the workload vs. executing the workload native on the host tells you the most about simulation efficiency if the host and the target are the same machine. The numbers get less useful if the host and target are different; there's also differences if the simulator executes some part of the program "native" (e.g., system calls). For example, a workload compiled for the EDSAC (17-bit words) and then run on a MIPS is unlikely to be close to the performance of the workload compiledd and run on the SPARC.
  - Number of host instructions per target instructions captures more of the "simulation efficiency" wihtout getting caught inthe confusion of processor implementation technologies. Howver, it potentially does the least accurate job of predicting real-time performance, as it may be unduly hurt by real-world concerns such as the number of cache misses. For example, SimICS got faster when the IR got smaller but more complicated to decode. The number of host instructions increased, but the overall running time decreased.
  - Multiprocessor performance is even harder to judge. For example, multiplexing target processors on a single host processor may induce TLB, cache and paging misses that lead to much worse performance. Conversely, I/O effects may be overlapped with simulation of other processors, reducing the effective overhead of simulation.
  - Simulating more costs more; simulators such as Shade, FX!32, etc. are as fast as they are in part because some parts of the overall workload (e.g., OS code) is executed native on the host machine, rather than simulating all host OS code.

  So what we see includes:

  - You can't measure the running time of a workload on a target that does not yet or no longer exists.
  - Anything that uses elapsed running times depends strongly on the implementation technology.
  - The real-world performance does vary depending on the implementation technology.
  - The host/target ratio fails to capture some significant effects, e.g., the SimICS example.
  - Multiprocessor simulation may cause higher miss rates in the processor cache, TLB and paging memory. Conversely, simulation may be overlapped with compuation.
  - Running more of the application as host code improves the observed running time and host/target instruction ratio.

  (I forget the details, but I'd definitely check out some of the early SimICS papers for a discussion of runnign times, Peter has more to say.)

  Hello everyone:
  
   I am glad to announce that my Ph.D. thesis, titled "Efficient Program
   Monitoring Techniques", is available on-line. This thesis was
   completed under the supervision of Prof. Charles Fischer at the
   department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin --Madison.
   The thesis is available as technical report # 1320. Please check it
   out at the URL:
   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/ncstrl.uwmadison%2fCS-TR-96-1320

  	Efficient Program Monitoring Techniques
  	---------------------------------------
  Programs need to be monitored for many reasons, including performance
  evaluation, correctness checking, and security. However, the cost of
  monitoring programs can be very high. This thesis contributes two
  techniques for reducing the high execution time overhead of program
  monitoring: 1) customization and 2) shadow processing. These
  techniques have been tested using a memory access monitoring system
  for C programs.
  
  "Customization" reduces the cost of monitoring programs by decoupling
  monitoring from original computation. A user program can be customized
  for any desired monitoring activity by deleting computation not
  relevant for monitoring. The customized program is smaller, easier to
  analyze, and almost always faster than the original program. It can be
  readily instrumented to perform the desired monitoring. We have
  explored the use of program slicing technology for customizing C
  programs. Customization can cut the overhead of memory access
  monitoring by up to half.
  
  "Shadow processing" hides the cost of on-line monitoring by using idle
  processors in multiprocessor workstations. A user program is
  partitioned into two run-time processes. One is the main process
  executing as usual, without any monitoring code. The other is a shadow
  process following the main process and performing the desired
  monitoring. One key issue in the use of shadow process is the degree
  to which the main process is burdened by the need to synchronize and
  communicate with the shadow process. We believe the overhead to the
  main process must be very modest to allow routine use of shadow
  processing for heavily-used production programs. We therefore limit
  the interaction between the two processes to communicating certain
  irreproducible values. In our experimental shadow processing system
  for memory access checking the overhead to the main process is very
  low - almost always less than 10%.  Further, since the shadow process
  avoids repeating some of the computations from the main program, it
  runs much faster than a single process performing both the computation
  and monitoring.

The first of a family, the tool is based on a patented Binary Code Instrumentation technology that displays a detailed analysis of an application's execution in Tracepoint's IDE. The company's core framework can handle executables and .dlls that have been generated by compiling software as well. Therefore, source code shouldn't have to be recompiled. The data can be viewed on a threads basis. HiProf is due out next month at $599 and runs on Win95 or NT 3.51 or later. It supports apps developed with VC++ 2.0 or above and Microsoft Developer Studio 4.03.

Since TestTrack works on compiled and linked binary code (no source code or obj files required), there=92s no need for recompiling or preprocessing so the entire process is dramatically quicker than with past generation tools. TestTrack analyzes and reports on coverage of several different types including; function coverage, class coverage, line coverage, branch coverage, multiple condition coverage, call-pair coverage and more. TestTrack allows you to selectively exclude portions of the code base , if desired, so you can analyze only those portions of an app that concern you. A robust and intuitive GUI displays results in "live" pie charts or bar graphs that let you drill down into the code represented with just a mouse click, extensive reporting capabilities include the ability to publish reports in html, and a powerful merge function allows you to merge the results of several test runs for total coverage analysis. In addition, TestTrack identifies dead code in your app which is no longer used but which can slow performance and bloat program size. An evaluation copy of the latest TestTrack beta is available for free download from TracePoint at www.tracepoint.com. TestTrack works on 32-bit apps generated with VC++ 2.x - 5.0.

  The SimOS team at Stanford University is pleased to announce the second release of our complete machine simulation environment. If you are receiving this email, then you have downloaded an earlier version of SimOS or were deemed "someone who may be interested". If you would like to be taken off this infrequently used list, send mail to "simos@cs.stanford.edu" and we'll take you off of it immediately.

  For those of you who need a refresher, SimOS is a "complete machine simulator" in that it models the hardware of uniprocessor and multiprocessor computers in enough detail to boot and run commercial operating systems as well as applications designed for these operating systems. This includes databases, web servers, and other workloads that traditional simulation tools have trouble supporting. Furthermore, SimOS executes these workloads at high speeds and provides support for easily collecting detailed hardware and software performance information.

  There have been substantial improvements and enhancements since the first SimOS release including:

  \* Support for the Digital Alpha architecture running the Digital Unix operating system.

  \* Support for the MIPS 64-bit architecture.

  \* More modular hardware simulator interfaces that simplify the process of adding new processor, memory system, and device models.

  SimOS is available free of charge for the research community and runs on several different hardware platforms. For download information, research papers, a discussion group, and more, visit the new SimOS web site at:

  . It describes the Inferno operating system, which is available both in native and application form and is VM-based, using dynamic translation to achieve (allegedly) a 1.5-2.5 times slowdown over native code. It is similar to TAOS in that it achieves application portability via a virtual machine.

     Method for verifying contiquity of a binary translated block of instructions
     by attaching a compare and/or branch instruction to predecessor block of
     instructions
    
    				  Abstract
    
     A method for enabling a first block of instructions to verify whether the
     first block of instructions follows a second block of instructions in an
     order of execution. The method includes appending a compare instruction to
     the first block of instructions. The compare instruction compares a first
     value from the first block of instructions with a second value from the
     second block of instructions, which precedes the first block of instructions
     in the order of execution. The method further includes appending a branching
     instruction to the first block of instructions. The branching instruction is
     executed in response to the first value being unequal to the second value.
     The branching instruction, when executed, branches to an alternative look-up
     routine to obtain a block of instructions that follows the second block of
     instructions in the order of execution.

       a) appending a compare instruction to the first block of instructions, the compare instruction when executed compares a
       first value from the first block of instructions with a second value from the second block of instructions, said second block
       of instructions preceding said first block of instructions in the order of execution; and 
       b) appending a branching instruction to the first block of instructions, said branching instruction is executed in response to
       the first value being unequal to the second value, said branching instruction, when executed, branches to an alternative
       look-up routine to obtain a block of instructions that follows the second block of instructions in the order of execution.

  specific instruction set of a specific processor by utilizing a simulator running on a second processing system having a second
  processor with a different instruction set. The simulator reduces the number of translated instructions needed to simulate the
  flow of control of the first processor instructions when translating the address of the next executable instruction resulting from a
  dynamic transfer of control, i.e., resulting from a return instruction. The simulator compares the address that is loaded at run time
  by the return instruction with the return address previously executed by that instruction. If the last return address matches, the
  location of the return is the same. If the last return does not match, a translate look-aside buffer is used to determine the address.
  If the translate look-aside buffer does not find the address, then a binary tree look up mechanism is used to determine the
  address of the next instruction after a return. The performance of the simulator is enhanced by utilizing the easiest approaches
  first in the chance that a translated instruction will result most efficiently.

                           Identifying plausible variable length machine code of selecting address in numerical
                           sequence, decoding code strings, and following execution transfer paths 

  ABSTRACT:   Information about the location of untranslated instructions in an original program is discovered during execution of a
  partial translation of the program, and that information is used later during re-translation of the original program. Preferably the
  information includes origin addresses of translated instructions and corresponding destination address of untranslated
  instructions of execution transfers that occur during the execution of the partial translation. Preferably this feedback of
  information from execution to re-translation is performed after each execution of the translated program so that virtually all of
  the instructions in the original program will eventually be located and translated. To provide an indication of the fraction of the
  code that has been translated, the program is scanned to find plausible code in the areas of memory that do not contain translated
  code. The plausible code is identified by selecting addresses according to three different scanning modes and attempting to
  decode variable-length instructions beginning at the selected addresses. The scanning modes include a first mode in which
  addresses are selected in numerical sequence by a scan pointer, a second mode in which addresses are selected in
  instruction-length sequence by an instruction decode pointer, and a third mode in which the selected addresses are destination
  addresses of previously-decoded execution transfer instructions.

  hat is claimed is: 
      26. A method of operating a digital computer having an addressable memory, said addressable memory containing a computer
  program, said computer program including instructions and data at respective address locations of said addressable memory,
  each of said instructions consisting of contents of a variable number of contiguous ones of said address locations depending upon
  an operation specified by said each of said instructions, said method identifying address locations of said addressable memory
  that appear to contain said instructions of said computer program, said method comprising the steps of: 

       a) selecting program addresses in numerical sequence, and attempting to decode an instruction in said addressable
       memory at each program address until an initial instruction is decoded; and when said initial instruction is decoded, then 
       b) attempting to decode a string of instructions immediately following said initial instruction until an execution transfer
       instruction is decoded, and when an attempt to decode an instruction fails, continuing said selecting program addresses
       and said attempting to decode an instruction at each program address as set out in said step a), and when an execution
       transfer instruction is decoded, then 
       c) attempting to decode an instruction at a destination address of the decoded execution transfer instruction, and when
       the attempt to decode an instruction at the destination address of the decoded execution transfer instruction fails,
       continuing said selecting program addresses and said attempting to decode an instruction at each program address as set
       out in step a), and when the attempt to decode an instruction at the destination address of the decoded execution transfer
       instruction succeeds, then identifying, as said address locations of said addressable memory that appear to contain said
       instructions of said computer program, the address locations including said initial instruction and said string of instructions
       including said execution transfer instruction, 
       wherein some program addresses of said computer program are known to contain instructions, and wherein said step a)
       skips over the program addresses that are known to contain instructions, 
       wherein the decoding of an instruction is not permitted when an instruction being decoded partially overlaps program
       addresses known to contain an instruction, and 
       wherein said step a) skips over a program address containing a value that is included in a predefined set of values,
       regardless of whether an attempt to decode an instruction starting at the program address would be successful, wherein
       said set of values includes values that indicate instructions having a length of one program address location, said set of
       values includes opcodes of privileged instructions, and said set of values includes the value of zero, and 
       wherein said step a) skips over a program address that is the first address of a string of at least four printable ASCII
       alphanumeric characters.

                           Method of using a target processor to execute programs of a source architecture that
                           uses multiple address spaces 

  ABSTRACT:   A method of utilizing large virtual addressing in a target computer to implement an instruction set translator (1ST)
  for dynamically translating the machine language instructions of an alien source computer into a set of functionally equivalent
  target computer machine language instructions, providing in the target machine, an execution environment for source machine
  operating systems, application subsystems, and applications. The target system provides a unique pointer table in target virtual
  address space that connects each source program instruction in the multiple source virtual address spaces to a target instruction
  translation which emulates the function of that source instruction in the target system. The target system efficiently stores the
  translated executable source programs by actually storing only one copy of any source program, regardless of the number of
  source address spaces in which the source program exists. The target system efficiently manages dynamic changes in the
  source machine storage, accommodating the nature of a preemptive, multitasking source operating system. The target system
  preserves the security and data integrity for the source programs on a par with their security and data integrity obtainable when
  executing in source processors (i.e. having the source architecture as their native architecture). The target computer execution
  maintains source-architected logical separations between programs and data executing in different source address
  spaces--without a need for the target system to be aware of the source virtual address spaces.

  Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters patent is: 
      1. An emulation method for executing individual source instructions in a target processor to execute source programs
  requiring source processor features not built into the target processor, comprising the steps of: 

       inputting instructions of a source processor program to an emulation target processor having significant excess virtual
       addressing capacity compared to a virtual addressing capacity required for a source processor to natively execute the
       source processor program, and supporting multiple source virtual address spaces in the operation of the source
       processor, 
       building a virtual ITM (instruction translation map) in a target virtual address space supported by the target processor, the
       virtual ITM containing an ITM entry for each source instruction addressable unit, each source instruction addressable
       unit beginning on a source storage instruction boundary, structuring each ITM entry for containing a translation address
       to a target translation program that executes a source instruction having a source address associated with the ITM entry,
       determining a ratio R by dividing the length of each ITM entry by the length of each source instruction addressable unit, 
       accessing an ITM entry for an executing source instruction by: 
           generating a source aggregate virtual address for the source instruction by combining the source address of the
           source instruction with a source address space identifier of a source virtual address space containing the
           instruction,
           multiplying the source aggregate virtual address by R to obtain a target virtual address component, and
           inserting the target virtual address component into a predetermined component location in a target virtual address
           to generate an ITM entry target virtual address for locating an ITM entry associated with the source instruction in
           order to obtain a one-to-one addressing relationship between ITM entry target virtual addresses and source
           instruction addresses.

                           Method and apparatus for the transparent emulation of an existing instruction-set
                           architecture by an arbitrary underlying instruction-set architecture 

  ABSTRACT:   The invention provides means and methods for extending an instruction-set architecture without impacting the
  software interface. This circumvents all software compatibility issues, and allows legacy software to benefit from new
  architectural extensions without recompilation and reassembly. The means employed are a translation engine for translating
  sequences of old architecture instructions into primary, new architecture instructions, and an extended instruction (EI) cache
  memory for storing the translations. A processor requesting a sequence of instructions will look first to the EI-cache for a
  translation, and if translations are unavailable, will look to a conventional cache memory for the sequence, and finally, if still
  unavailable, will look to a main memory.

  I claim: 
      1. A method for translating a series of one or more instructions of a first semantic type into one or more instructions of a
  second semantic type, comprising the steps of: 

       providing a first memory; 
       providing a second memory; 
       translating a sequence of instructions of the first semantic type stored in the first memory into one or more primary
       instructions of the second semantic type and storing the instructions of the second type in the second memory; 
       upon a request from the processor for the sequence of instructions of the first semantic type: 
           providing the corresponding instructions of the second semantic type if available in the second memory;
           providing the sequence of instructions of the first semantic type if the corresponding instructions of the second
           semantic type are not available in the second memory.

  ABSTRACT:   An address control system for software simulation in a virtual machine system having a virtual storage function.
  When a simulator program is simulating an instruction of a program to be simulated, an address translation of an operand address
  in the program to be simulated is achieved using a translation lookaside buffer, thereby greatly reducing the overhead for the
  address translation during the simulator program execution.

                          Emulating computer 

  ABSTRACT:   An apparatus and method is disclosed for providing an emulating computer. The present invention consists of a
  computer having a storage area, processing unit, control circuits and translation circuit. The original instructions are first loaded
  into the storage area. When the processor attempts to operate an instruction the control circuit loads a section of the instructions
  into the translating circuit. These instructions are then translated and stored in a memory area of the translating circuit having the
  address of the original instruction. The processor unit then accesses the storage area and retrieves the translated instruction. 

  What is claimed is: 
      7. A method of emulating a computer comprising the steps of: 

       transmitting an instruction to a processing unit; 
       checking a cache memory for a translated instruction; 
       loading an instruction block into an instruction memory if said translated instruction is not in said cache memory; 
       translating an instruction of said instruction block providing a translated instruction; 
       storing said translated instruction in said cache memory; and 
       transmitting said translated instruction from said cache memory to said processing unit.

- Find/write up a 1984 bib cite on a Bell Labs project to emulate the PDP-11. They implemented it in portable FORTRAN (minus some host-specific work around to handle random access files for swapping the simulated memory). They were able to boot Unix straight from distribution tapes. The work as done 81-82, I believe. The intention was to simplify bootstrapping Unix on new hardware in environments that did not have an existing Unix machine. The objective sort of failed since by the time they got it working, Unix was so succesful, few locations were that desperate. Their slowdown was about 120, and among other ideas they said that they could re-implement the interpreter kernel using threaded code for performance.

  TeraGen architecture primes single engine for multiple instruction sets

   

  (01/25/99, 02:08:32 PM EDT).

  - TeraGen Corp., Sunnyvale CA.
  - Microcontroller.
  - Translates multiple ISAs on the fly to ``POPs'' (primitive operations) for scheduling on a VLIW.
  - (Unclear how this differs from superscaler or simultaneous multithreading).

  - TeraGen cofounder Don Sollers was a principal architect of the DSP architecture being brought to market by ZSP Corp., which uses conventional superscalar techniques to increase signal-processing throughput. Sollers earlier worked on processors at Digital and Sun and was principal architect of the Supersparc II.
  - The key advantage ... will be its ability to execute the code from several different processing cores on one engine.
  - The TeraGen engine is adapted to additional instruction sets by adding a ``small block of fast ROM'' to govern the translation of the new instructions into POPs.
  - A ROM can also be set up to translate a set of hardware functions into POPs. The TeraGen engine could thus be configured to emulate peripheral functions as well as other processors.
  - Instructions streams for all processors/emulated peripherals flow to the scheduler, where each is translated into POPs. The resulting streams of VLIW-like operations are then scheduled for execution.
  - A key feature is ... ``a large, fast data cache used for register emulation. By allocating cache locations to represent each of the registers for each of the instruction sets it is emulating, the TeraGen engine apparently can blend POPs from different streams of instructions into a single flow. It thus can theoretically find opportunities for parallelism that would escape a conventional superscalar or VLIW architecture.''
  - Put another way, the system uses a virtual register file in a cache to emulate the register file. Stollers said ``This is part of our secret sauce: The cache can be accessed as a register.''
  - Stollers said ``We have the capability to manage and schedule operations within an RTOS. This approach would allow the control logic to run at the same speed as the data path, which is what real-world multiprocessing is all about.''
  - Note that all emulated processors/devices get faster together as the TeraGen is made faster.
  - CEO George Alexy was recruited from Cirrus Logic Inc. in mid-1998 to head up TeraGen.
  - Alexy said two semiconductor companies have taken licenses, initially for 8-bit applications; they will reach silicon within the year.
  - Will Strauss, principal at Forward Concepts (Tempe, Ariz.), says there may be legal questions about emulation.
  - Strauss says most DSP designs use a Harvard architecture; TeraGen employs a unique register-file approach.
  - Quoting from the above article, ``The ability to reuse code while combining a DSP and an MCU may be unique to TeraGen, Sollers said. The StarCore approach now being developed by Motorola and Lucent is working toward combining a DSP and an MCU on the same die, but Sollers claimed that the StarCore effort "will almost be forced to adopt a new ISA. In our approach, we allow people to use a familiar ISA. From a top-level perspective, what we are doing is allowing people to configure a system-on-chip through software. That is where the flexibility of this approach comes from."''
  - TeraGen "breaks very complex tasks into primitives very quickly, to achieve an advantage that way. The POPs are long instructions-a native instruction set that is dramatically different from what previous architectures have attempted. How we hierarchically establish our instructions is our inherent advantage."
  - TeraGen has a staff of about 20 engineers.
  - Analyst Strauss said TeraGen may quickly run into intellectual-property issues.
  - TeraGen has attracted $9 million in investment capital from Sequoia Capital Partners and InterWest Partners.

  TITLE:  Jalapeno --- a new Java Virtual Machine for Servers
  
  SPEAKER: Vivek Sarkar
           IBM T. J. Watson Research Center
  
  ABSTRACT:
  
  In this talk, we give an overview of the Jalapeno Java Virtual Machine
  (JVM) research project at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center.  The
  goal of Jalapeno is to expand the frontier of JVM technologies for
  server nodes --- especially in the areas of dynamic optimized
  compilation and specialization, scalable exploitation of multiple
  processors in SMPs, and the use of a JVM as a 7x24 application server.
  
  The Jalapeno JVM has two key distinguishing features.  First, the
  Jalapeno JVM takes a compile-only approach to program execution.
  Instead of providing both an interpreter and a JIT/dynamic compiler,
  it provides two dynamic compilers --- a quick non-optimizing
  "baseline" compiler, and a slower production-strength optimizing
  compiler.  Both compilers share the same interfaces with the rest of
  the JVM, thus making it easy to mix execution of unoptimized methods
  with optimized methods.  Second, the Jalapeno JVM is itself
  implemented in Java!  This design choice brings with it several
  advantages as well as technical challenges. The advantages include a
  uniform memory space for JVM objects and application objects, and ease
  of portability.  The key technical challenge is to overcome the large
  performance penalties of executing Java code (compared to native code)
  that has been the experience of current JVMs; if we succeed in doing
  so, we will simultaneously improve the performance of our JVM as well
  as of the applications running on our JVM.
  
  The Jalapeno project was initiated in January 1998 and is still work
  in progress.  This talk will highlight our design decisions and early
  experiences in working towards our goal of building a high-performance
  JVM for SMP servers.

  > "What's visible about software is the effect it has on something else. If two thoroughly different programs have the same observable effects, you cannot tell which one has executed. If a given portion of a program has no observable effects, then you have no way of knowing if it is executing, if it has finished, if it got part way through and then stopped, or if it produced 'the right answer.' Programmers nearly always must rely on highly indirect measures to determine what happens when their programs execute. This is one reason why debugging is so difficult."

  ABSTRACT This article describes the Digital Continuous Profiling Infrastructure, a sampling-based profiling system designed to run continuously on production systems. The system supports multiprocessors, works on unmodified executables, and collects profiles for entire systems, including user programs, shared libraries, and the operating system kernel. Samples are collected at a high rate (over 5200 samples/sec. per 333MHz processor), yet with low overhead (1-3% slowdown for most workloads). Analysis tools supplied with the profiling system use the sample data to produce a precise and accurate accounting, down to the level of pipeline stalls incurred by individual instructions, of where time is bring spent. When instructions incur stalls, the tools identify possible reasons, such as cache misses, branch mispredictions, and functional unit contention. The fine-grained instruction-level analysis guides users and automated optimizers to the causes of performance problems and provides important insights for fixing them.

  Valgrind is a memory tracing tool by Julian Seward `jseward@acm.org` and Nick Nethercote `njn25@acm.ac.uk`. Inofrmation at [`http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj`](http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/) including ``The design and implementation of Valgrind'' from [`http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/docs/techdocs.html`](http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/docs/techdocs.html). Notes: GPL'd. For finding memory-management problems. Targeted for x86 GNU/Linux executables. Dynamically link with executable using `-z initfirst` so it runs before any other object in the image; Valgrind thus gains control. Translates and instruments basic blocks; saved in translation cache and mapped by a translation table. Fast map typically has 98% hit rate. Translations are procedures; they return the virtual (not physical) `eip`. The main loop does all dispatch. Translation storage management uses an approximate LRU algorithm. Multiple main loop entry points handle special cases such as returns of system call handlers; calls to `malloc()`, `free()`, etc. User memory is tracked at the level of allocation blocks. Tracking information includes the call stack at allocation time. Calls to `free()` look for tracking information, if none, the block has already been freed or was never allocate and an error is signaled. If found, the block is marked inaccessible and the tracking information goes on a free list to look for invalid accesses. Various per-byte information via a sparse map of the entire 4G address space -- 64K sections mapping 64KB each, indexed by the high and low 16 bits of the address, respectively. Valgrind supports `--stop-after=` to return to native execution. Among other things, this helps with a binary search for Valgrind bugs. To support native execution, memory must be identical whether or not running on the simulated CPU. Signals are handled ``differently'' -- because they arrive asynchronously, `--stop-after=` varies. Thus, there is a mode to run all signals native. Valgrind also uses a different stack format than native, so a given signal must be handled all-native or all-Valgrind. Contains numerous assertions and internal checks, which are enabled all the time; more expensive checks are done once every N uses of the relevant coe. Some very slow checks are only enabled optionally: low-level memory management complete checks; symbol table reader; per-byte tracking; translation IR sanity checking; system call wrapper sanity checks; main loop `%ebp`; register allocator checks. Most symbols prefixed using a CPP macro; `malloc()`, `free()`, etc. are intercepted and have the usual names. Is largely independent of other shared objects, avoids conflicts if Valgrind and the application simultaneously execute impure code. Also, `glibc` defines `sigset_t` differently than the kernel, and Valgrind uses the kernel definition. Still imports too many ``unsafe'' `.h` files. Limitations include: no threads (``most-requested feature'', needs fast mutex and race safety), no MMX, support for non-POSIX signals, Linux API is not a module, so nontrivial to port to other APIs. Does not use `%edi` in order to avoid save/restore issues around ``special uses''. Translations are position-independent and are moved in TC as part of LRU management. `%ebp` always points at a fixed region except on translation return a special value indicates the return virtual pc requires special handling. Thus, virtual state accesses use `N(%ebp)` addressing. with the most common using 8-bit immediates. Values are re-homed at the end of every translation. Snapshotting initial state takes place before Valgrind is set up; therefore, dump state to a static area, initialize, home. System calls operate on the virtual state except the program counter is the real (Valgrind) value. Need to save Valgrind state while faking up system call state. Horror: may need to handle a second system call while blocked inside a first system call, so actually a stack of Valgrind save areas. Translation based on UCode to avoid details of the x86. UCode is approximately 2-address code, with a third field for immediates. UCode is much simpler than x86; for example only `LOAD` and `STORE` touch memory. Register allocation on UCode but some fixup done later. Valgrind does not use the FPU, so simulation is much easier. Valgrind does not cache FPU state across multiple FPU instructions. Optimisation passes can be disabled. Instrumentation can be disabled. Can single-step. UCode is annotated with memory instrumentation code. Code generation aided by GNU superopt v2.5. Memory instrumentation is 1==problem 0==valid; unintuitive, but faster to test against 0 than all 1's. Code generation is paranoid about partial-register updates. Simulated `%esp` is not updated lazily because the instrumenter needs the current value. Instrumentation is at the UCode level, rather than the x86 level. Valgrind attempts to track defined-ness of memory at the bit level, but ``throws in the towel'' on things that call helper functions. Optimize bit-level referneces that touch a whole object. Valgrind runs on top of a `setjmp`-installed exception handler so segfaults, etc., can bail out of current translation. `%eip` is kept within 4 bytes of real. Signals are queued and checked every 1000 blocks. Signal frames have a Valgrind return address for frame cleanup, but some signals e.g., `longjmp()` to exit. No systematic verification or regression. Has a cache simulator -- tracks which instructions have effects, not just the cache effects. Data structure for cache/instruction must not be discarded when the instruction is discarded. Projects include user-defined permission ranges.

  Questions: Can Valgrind run itself? The `-z` trick suggests no. Probably no SSE/SSE2. Further explanation of nested system calls (how they arise) would be useful.

  > A simulator is a powerful tool for hardware as well as software development. However, implementing an efficient simulator by hand is a very labour intensive and error-prone task. This paper describes a tool for automatic generation of efficient instruction set architecture (ISA) simulators. A specification file describing the ISA is used as input to the tool. Besides a simulator, the tool also generates an assembler and a disassembler for the architecture. We present a method where statistics is used to identify frequently used instructions. Special versions of these instructions are then created by the tool in order to speed up the simulator. With this technique we have generated a SPARC V8 simulator which is more efficient than our hand-coded and hand-optimized one.''

  T97-02 Performance Debugging and Tuning using an Instruction-Set Simulator (PostScript) Peter S. Magnusson, Johan Montelius

  > Instruction-set simulators allow programmers a detailed level of insight into, and control over, the execution of a program, including parallel programs and operating systems. In principle, instruction set simulation can model any target computer and gather any statistic. Furthermore, such simulators are usually portable, independent of compiler tools, and deterministic-allowing bugs to be recreated or measurements repeated. Though often viewed as being too slow for use as a general programming tool, in the last several years their performance has improved considerably. We describe SIMICS, an instruction set simulator of SPARC-based multiprocessors developed at SICS, in its role as a general programming tool. We discuss some of the benefits of using a tool such as SIMICS to support various tasks in software engineering, including debugging, testing, analysis, and performance tuning. We present in some detail two test cases, where we've used SimICS to support analysis and performance tuning of two applications, Penny and EQNTOTT. This work resulted in improved parallelism in, and understanding of, Penny, as well as a performance improvement for EQNTOTT of over a magnitude. We also present some early work on analyzing SPARC/Linux, demonstrating the ability of tools like SimICS to analyze operating systems. (NOTE: A later version of this report was published in ILPS'97)
