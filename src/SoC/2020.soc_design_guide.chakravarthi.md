## 2 System on Chip (SOC) Design

### 2.2 Constituents of SOC

* general-purpose processors
* DSP processors
* embedded memory
* protocol block
* controllers for external memories
* standard interface controllers
  * USB cores
  * PCIe cores
  * ...
* clock generation and stabilization blocks
* power management blocks
* analog interfaces
* keyboard and disply interfaces
* radio interfaces
* boot loader
* embedded software
* ...

#### 2.3.5 System Module Development Feasibility Study

> In spite of system evaluation by means of system modelling,
> assuring the implementation possibility and hardware design constrains may restrict to achieving the design goal;
> in which case,
> the feasibility of the achieving the design target is realized by evaluating alternate implementations and selecting the right one.
