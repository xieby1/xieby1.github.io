## Foreword

> Fundamentally, Chisel is a library of classes and functions representing the primitives necessary to express synchronous, digital circuits.
> A Chisel design is really a Scala program that generates a circuit as it executes.

## Introduction

> Chisel itself is not a big language.
> The basic constructs fit on one page and can be learned within a few days.
> Therefore, this book is not a big book, as well.
