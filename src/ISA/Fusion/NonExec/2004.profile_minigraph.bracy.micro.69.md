* handle是（至多）2读1写的“类指令”
* 用MGT存handle => insts的对应关系
* 执行阶段依旧采用insts而非handle的粒度

> A mini-graph pipeline processes both unmodified
> and modified executables and treats handles as individ-
> ual instructions in all stages except execution. During
> execution, the processor consults a handle-to-instruction
> sequence translation which is stored in an on-chip table
> called the mini-graph table (MGT). Essentially a
> microcode store, the MGT drives the cycle-by-cycle
> execution of the constituent mini-graph instructions
> with low overhead.

> The most important aspect of making handles
> behave like instructions is choosing mini-graphs that are
> atomic.
