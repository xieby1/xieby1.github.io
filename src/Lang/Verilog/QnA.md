## [TODO] Latch vs Register

## [TODO] <= ?

### Q:

`reg <=`生成Register？
`wire <=`生成Latch？

所以Verilog语法上<=在干嘛？
单纯只是操作符重载吗？还是表示和时钟相关的操作？

### A:

verilog-std-1364-2005.pdf: p118: 9.2.1:

> The = assignment operator used by blocking procedural assignments is also used by procedural continuous␍
assignments and continuous assignments.

## [TODO] synthesizable?

latch?
