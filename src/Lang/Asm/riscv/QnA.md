## RISC-V如何ratify一个指令集模块

RISC-V指令手册里有提及指令集模块是否ratified，想看他们是以什么标准来ratify的。想知道RISC-V作为一个开放（OPEN）的指令集是如何接受新的指令集模块的。目前还没能找到这些资源。

[RISC-V Foundation Announces Ratification of the Processor Trace Specification](https://riscv.org/2020/03/risc-v-foundation-announces-ratification-of-the-processor-trace-specification/)参考这个trace扩展的新闻，

> *Ratification signifies another breakthrough for the thriving RISC-V ecosystem*
> San Francisco – March 9 2020 – The RISC-V Foundation, a non-profit corporation **controlled by its members to drive the adoption and implementation of the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA)**, today announced the ratification of the processor trace specification. The new standard trace encoder algorithm allows engineers and developers to see exactly what instructions a core is executing, step by step. The processor trace specification will be enormously helpful to aid debugging by exposing accurate and detailed traces of activity, with filtering capabilities to isolate the trace portions that matter.

我高亮的那句话，所以ratify大概是成员投票吧，至于成员用什么方法评估就不得而知了。
