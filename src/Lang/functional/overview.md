* [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)

A function can only be memoized if it is [referentially transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency);
that is, only if calling the function has exactly the same effect as replacing that function call with its return value

* [referentially transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency)
  * pure
  * no side effects
  * mathematical function
  * functional programming
