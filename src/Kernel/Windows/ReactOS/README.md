**前言**：在看[build-win2k3](https://rentry.co/build-win2k3)中注意到的ReactOS，这个稳定的作者认为win nt5源码的泄漏不会对ReactOS/WINE有太大帮助（我不信🙃）

> ###### Is this code going to help ReactOS/WINE in any way?
>
> No, those projects would never want to make use of such stolen/illegal code (ReactOS even performed their own year-long code audit when it was claimed that they used an older leaked codebase!).
>
> Even hinting that you have knowledge of Windows internals learned through code like this is enough to disqualify you from contributing to them (on that note, **if you ever want to work on ReactOS/WINE in the future you should probably quit looking into this source code while you still can!**)

## ReactOS

Windows兼容，开源操作系统。曾经和WINE有微妙的关系，

> It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past.
