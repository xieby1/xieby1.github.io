# X-Cache: A Modular Architecture for Domain-Specific Caches

Terminology:

* non-affine memeory access
* cache
  * data-structure walks
  * multiple refills
  * preloading
* data orchestration

## Intro

Emerging DSAs target a broad set of applications characterized by

* Non-affine data structure

  DSAs typically organize data in DRAM with a minimal footprint.
  Hence, they employ sparse data structures, indirect-indexes, and hash tables.
  Getting an element's global address requires data structure traversal

* Dynamic accesses

  Both the data structure and loop pattern cause emerging DSAs to have dynamic (i.e. indirectly addressed) and irregular non-linear accesses.
  A cache is necessary to capture the reuse.

* Walkers

  Since data is stored in non-linear data structures, a walker is required to traverse and preload the cache.
  A single miss could trigger multiple nested preloads

* Explicit orchestration

  Finally, DSAs need to explicitly orchestrate cache replacement and refill with the computational datapaths.
