Register windows是比较老的技术了？
参考[Wikipedia: Register_window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_window)

> In the Berkeley RISC design, only eight registers out of a total of 64 are visible to the programs.
> The complete set of registers are known as the register file, and any particular set of eight as a window.
> The file allows up to eight procedure calls to have their own register sets.
> As long as the program does not call down chains longer than eight calls deep, the registers never have to be spilled, i.e. saved out to main memory or cache which is a slow process compared to register access.

Register window的缺点是寄存器利用率低。

* 1999 Alpha 21264寄存器堆分成两个banks（一级）
* 1978 CRAY-1寄存器堆分成两级
